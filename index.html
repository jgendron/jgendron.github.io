<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This site contains links to easily visit GitHub Pages with project work, R Shiny apps, and presentations. Allow me to introduce myself. I am part of the competitively selected <a href="https://www.boozallen.com/">Booz Allen Hamilton</a> Data Science Cohort and have been working in the data science space for 14 years. I am a data storyteller who provides answers to client questions through data in an engaging and accessible approach. <strong>Four C's</strong> describe me: <strong>Creative</strong>, <strong>Critical</strong> Thinking to deliver a quality product on time, <strong>Collaborative</strong>, and <strong>Contribute</strong> to the client and the organization.</p>
 
<p>I have a rich and diverse background of professional and self-driven experiences with qualifications in executing technical analysis, running the business operations of a software development company, and connecting the dots between technical and business people. I am an artist, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Business-Intelligence-Jay-Gendron-ebook/dp/B01F7HCAWG?ie=UTF8&qid=1465068114&ref_=tmm_kin_swatch_0&sr=8-1">author</a>, and lifelong learner. Technically, I am multilingual and can conduct analyses and program on numerous platforms.</p>

<a id="Projects You Can Visit" class="anchor" href="#github-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects You Can Visit</h3>

<p>Here is a sample of projects I have enjoyed completing for a variety of purposes. They represent a spectrum of different analytic methods.</p>

<h4>
<a id="Machine Learning" class="anchor" href="#machine-learning" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Machine Learning
</h4>

<p>Here is a <strong>k-means cluster</strong> analysis that provides an <a href="https://jgendron.shinyapps.io/Ch8-CampaignCreatorApp/">interactive tool</a> for developing marketing campaigns. It is a capstone project for my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Business-Intelligence-Jay-Gendron-ebook/dp/B01F7HCAWG">Introduction to R for Business Intelligence</a> coming out in the Fall of 2016. This <a href="https://github.com/jgendron/com.packtpub.intro.r.bi">link to the codebase</a> provides all the code for the book. Chapter 5 focuses on clustering techniques.</p>

<h4>
<a id="Text Analytics" class="anchor" href="#text-analytics" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Text Analytics
</h4>   

<p>The value of text-based information continues to increase. Alan Turing (1950) opens his influential article "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" with the statement, "I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'" <a href="http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html">(p. 433)</a>. Overall, this Turing Test has become a basis of natural language
processing. The essence of this project was to take a corpus of text and build an <a href="http://jgendron.shinyapps.io/predictngram">interactive model</a> presenting a user with a prediction of the next likely word based on their input. Details of the model development are found in the paper entitled *Natural Language Processing: A Model to Predict a Sequence of Words* presented during the MODSIM 2015 World Conference. The full paper is freely available at the conference's published online proceedings.

<a id="Process Mining and Simulation" class="anchor" href="#process-mining" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Process Mining and Simulation
</h4>

<p> 
Process mining is a form of process modeling introduced by Prof Wil van der Aalst in the Department of Mathematics & Computer Science at the Eindhoven University of Technology. It blends the disciplines of data mining with model-based process analysis to discover insights about processes. This project <a href="https://github.com/jgendron/ProbabilityProcessFootprint ">developed a simulation</a> to use with process mining techniques and explained in the paper entitled <italic>Improve Test Results by Piloting: How to Simulate Field Data in the Lab</italic> presented during the <a href="http://www.modsimworld.org/">MODSIM 2016 World Conference</a>. The full paper is freely available at the conference's published online proceedings.

<h3>Creating Community</h3>

<p>I believe staying active in the community. This includes activities like peer-to-peer mentoring and involvement on <a href="https://medium.com/course-studies/interview-series-jay-gendron-a158c3bd34bc#.abd7pjg7m">social media</a>. Most recently is a project to cuild a community of data science managers - to help one another when management challenges arise. The site <a href="http://www.datasciencemanagement.com">Data Science Management</a> is prototyped and data science professionals have been asked to join as thought leaders for the community.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributorâ€™s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
